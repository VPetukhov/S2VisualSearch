# Semantic Scholar Search Visualization

The project consists of two parts.

## Backend

Run `serve_w2v.py` to create a server, which embeds texts using word2vec.

## Frontend

- `index.js` has JS functions for text visualization.
- `index.html` wraps it into a web-page

To serve the web-site, go to `frontend` and run `snowpack dev`.
